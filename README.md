Hi Guys,
I’m Yashasvee — a designer just trying to find her anchor so she doesn’t sink.
This started as a fun, chaotic weekend project and turned into something I’m proud of! 🎉
Meet Mimi Notes — a cute, minimal notepad for your daily to-dos. Jot them down, clear them out when you’re done, and enjoy the simplicity. ✍️✨
It’s designed to be straight, simple, and super lightweight.
Hope you like it! ❤️
